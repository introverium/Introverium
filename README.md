What is Introveriumcoin?
----------------

Introverium is an experimental privacy based cryptocurrency that enables anonymous payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Introverium uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Introverium Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Introverium Core software, see [https://introverium.com](https://introverium.com).

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/introverium/introverium/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Introverium Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
